# Blackjack
## This is a simple in-console Blackjack game I developed for my game development class.
### <p> How To Start: </p>
> 1) Download the repository to your local files:
>> - Click the green-highlighted button that says "Code"
>> - From the drop-down, copy & paste the URL given.
>> - In your command terminal, navigate to the location you desire to download it.
>>> - Type 'ls' without quotations to see which folders you can access.
>>> - Type 'cd <FolderName>' without quotations or the <> to access the folder.
>>> - Type 'cd ..' to go back a folder.
>> - Use the command 'git clone <URL here>'' without the <> or quotations.
>>> - If you are getting an error, you may have to download the git clone command first.
>>> - To do so, navigate to the folder you would like to download it to and type '$ sudo apt-get update' (without quotations).
>>> - Then, type '$ sudo apt-get install git' (without quotations).
>>>> - To verify it has been downloaded, type '$ git --version' without quotations to view the version type you have downloaded.
>>>> - If the download was unsuccessful, you will instead get an error saying it was unable to be found.
> 2) Navigate into the project folder:
>> - In the command terminal, use 'cd <FolderName>' without quotations or the <> to access the Blackjack folder.
>> - You should see a file labeled blackjack.py.
> 3) Run the game:
>> - If the blackjack.py file is not bolded, you will need to compile it.
>>> - You can compile this by typing 'chmod u+x blackjack.py'
>> - If it is already bolded, you may now run the game by typing './blackjack.py' in your command terminal.
